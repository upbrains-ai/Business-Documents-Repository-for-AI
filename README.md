# Business-Documents-Repository-for-AI
This repository is a community place for gathering pointers to Business Documents that are available for use in R&amp;D and machine learning and AI projects. The goal of this effort is to foster sharing business documents in support of machine learning and AI research in Document Intelligence topics.

## General (Assorted) Forms <a name="formsassorted"></a>

- FUNSD <br>
**URL**: https://guillaumejaume.github.io/FUNSD/ <br>
Desc:  The dataset comprises of 199 real-wold fully annotated, scanned forms. The forms are selected from RVL-CDIP dataset, which is in turn  subset of the Truth Tobacco Industry Document (TTID). The dataset is broken into a training set consisting of 149 forms, and 50 testing documents. <br>
Tasks: OCR, text detection, question answering, entity (sequence) labeling, entity linking. <br>
Labels: There are 4 main labels on the span of text in the documens, i.e., header, question, answer, and other.  <br>

- XFUND <br>
URL: https://github.com/doc-analysis/XFUND <br>
Desc: XFUND is a multilingual form understanding benchmark dataset that includes human-labeled forms with key-value pairs in 7 languages (Chinese, Japanese, Spanish, French, Italian, German, Portuguese). <br>
Tasks: Semantic Entity Recognition, Relation Extraction.<br>
Labels: Header,	Question,	Answer,	Other<br>

- NAF (National Archives Forms) Dataset<br>
URL: https://github.com/herobd/NAF_dataset <br>
Desc: The goal of this data is to capture relationships between text/handwriting entities on form images.<br>
Tasks: Semantic Entity Recognition, Relation Extraction. <br>
Labels: Label, Value (key - value). <br>

- GHEGHA Dataset<br>
URL: https://machinelearning.inginf.units.it/data-and-tools/ghega-dataset <br>
Desc:  The dataset contains two groups of documents: 110 data-sheets of electronic components and 136 patents. Each group is divided in classes: data-sheets classes share the component type and producer; patents classes share the patent source.<br>
Tasks: OCR, Semantic Entity Recognition, Information Extraction. <br>
Labels: Document Classes, data-sheets: Model, Type, Case, Power Dissipation, Storage Temperature, Voltage, Weight, Thermal Resistance;
Patents: Title, Applicant, Inventor, Representative, Filing Date, Publication Date, Application Number, Publication Number, Priority, Classification, Abstract 1st line.<br>

## Receipts <a name="receipts"></a>

- SROIE (Scanned Receipts OCR and Information Extraction) <br>
URL: https://rrc.cvc.uab.es/?ch=13<br>
Desc:  This dataset is prepared for ICDAR 2019 Robust Reading Challenge on Scanned Receipts OCR and Information Extraction. The dataset is split into a training/validation set (“trainval”) and a test set. The trainval set consists of 600 receipt images and the “test” set consists of 400 images.<br>
Tasks: Text localization, OCR, key information extraction. <br>
Labels: <br>

- CORD ( A Consolidated Receipt Dataset for Post-OCR Parsing)<br>
URL: https://github.com/clovaai/cord<br>
Desc: 1000 Indonesian receipts collected from shops and restaurants.<br>
Tasks: Semantic entity labeling, Information Extraction. <br>
Labels: Fine-grained classes: five superclass and 42 subclass labels.<br>
